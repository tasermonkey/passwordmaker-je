PasswordMaker Java Edition Change Log

0.6.0
  - "Default" account behavior added.  This allows for dynamic URLs to be used
    unlike the static URLs used in other accounts. This matches the behavior
    of the web verison of passwordmaker.
  - When filtering accounts, the account tree now expands to show the accounts
    as well as selects the 1st possible account.
  - Added hotkeys (use "command" in OSX):
      Ctrl+F = Jump to filter textbox (still makes a system beep, not
               really sure why).
      Ctrl+N = New
      Ctrl+O = Open
      Ctrl+S = Save
      Pressing enter in the filter textbox jumps to the master pasword textbox.
  - Fixed bug where the password was generated incorrectly while adding a
    new account.
  - The source code has been partitioned into an engine set of packages and
    an application set of packages. This allows the engine to be used in other
    applications.
  - Fixed bugs where "Open" and "New" didn't prompt for saving of the current
    file. 
  - Added a few more unit tests.
  -
